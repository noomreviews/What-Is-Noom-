Noom is a weight loss app that uses a holistic approach to help individuals achieve their health and fitness goals. Unlike traditional diet programs that focus mainly on calorie-counting or restricting certain foods, Noom emphasizes behavior change and a personalized, sustainable lifestyle. It’s not just about following a temporary diet plan—Noom aims to help users build lasting habits that will support long-term weight management.

The app was founded in 2008 by Saeju Jeong and Artem Petakov, and it has grown into a multi-million-dollar business with millions of active users worldwide. It has attracted attention due to its unique integration of psychology and technology, offering more than just a simple diet plan.
